# fitbit-media-remote

Simple media controls, on your wrist! Works in conjunction with my [linux media control server](https://github.com/oswalde-p/media-control-server)
to send simple instructions over HTTP.

Currently supports play/pause, volume up and volume down actions.

Use the app settings page to set the url of your media server.
